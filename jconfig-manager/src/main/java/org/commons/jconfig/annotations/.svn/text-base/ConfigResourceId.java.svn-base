/**
 * {@link ConfigManager} use the method names by default, to load config values
 * from config files. For example if the method name is getFgRetries,
 * setFgRetries on the config class, {@link ConfigManager} will try to load a
 * property with name "FgRetries" by default. if present on the method @ConfigResourceId
 * annotations will instruct {@link ConfigManager} to use this name first,
 * instead of the method name.
 * 
 * ConfigResourceId was introduced for backward compatibility, for config files
 * that cannot be changed or where the usage of long names is required and these
 * names would not conform to java syntax.
